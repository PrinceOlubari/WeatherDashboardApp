# Challenge 8 Weather DashBoard 

## Description

In this challenge, I was tasked to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS which was given in the starter code.
I used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. I registered for a new API key, which took some time time for that API key to be activated.


## steps taken

1. Created a new GitHub repo called `WeatherDashBoardApp`. Then, cloned it to my computer.

2. Copied the starter files into my local git repository.

## Tasks

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
